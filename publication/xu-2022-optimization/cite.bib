 abstract = {The linac-based test facility FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac Und Test Experiment) at KIT will be used to study novel accelerator technology and provide intense THz pulses. In this paper, we present start-to-end simulation studies of FLUTE with different bunch charges. We employ a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm for different bunch charges of FLUTE to find optimized accelerator settings for the generation of intense THz radiation.},
