abstract: FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac- und Test-Experiment) at KIT is a compact linac-based
  test facility for novel accelerator technology and a source of intense THz radiation.
  FLUTE is designed to provide a wide range of electron bunch charges from the pC-
  to nC-range, high electric fields up to 1.2 GV/m, and ultra-short THz pulses down
  to the fs-timescale. The electrons are generated at the RF photoinjector, where
  the electron gun is driven by a commercial titanium sapphire laser. In this kind
  of setup the electron beam properties are determined by the photoinjector, but more
  importantly by the characteristics of the laser pulses. Spatial light modulators
  can be used to transversely and longitudinally shape the laser pulse, offering a
  flexible way to shape the laser beam and subsequently the electron beam, influencing
  the produced THz pulses. However, nonlinear effects inherent to the laser manipulation
  (transportation, compression, third harmonic generation) can distort the original
  pulse. In this paper we propose to use machine learning methods to manipulate the
  laser and electron bunch, aiming to generate tailor-made THz pulses. The method
  is demonstrated experimentally in a test setup.
