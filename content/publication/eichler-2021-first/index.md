abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning algorithms have risen in popularity in recent years
  in the accelerator physics community, showing potential in beam control and in the
  optimization and automation of tasks in accelerator operation. The Helmholtz AI
  project \"Machine Learning toward Autonomous Accelerators\" is a collaboration between
  DESY and KIT that works on investigating and developing RL applications for the
  automatic start-up of electron linear accelerators. The work is carried out in parallel
  at two similar research accelerators: ARES at DESY and FLUTE at KIT, giving the
  unique opportunity of transfer learning between facilities. One of the first steps
  of this project is the establishment of a common interface between the simulations
  and the machine, in order to test and apply various optimization approaches interchangeably
  between the two accelerators. In this paper we present the first results on the
  common interface and its application to beam focusing in ARES, and the idea of laser
  shaping with spatial light modulators at FLUTE.'
