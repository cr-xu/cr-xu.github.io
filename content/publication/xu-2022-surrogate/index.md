abstract: Numerical beam dynamics simulations are essential tools in the study and
  design of particle accelerators, but they can be prohibitively slow for online prediction
  during operation or for systematic evaluations of new parameter settings. Machine
  learning-based surrogate models of the accelerator provide much faster predictions
  of the beam properties and can serve as a virtual diagnostic or to augment data
  for reinforcement learning training. In this paper, we present the first results
  on training a surrogate model for the low-energy section at the Ferninfrarot Linac-
  und Test-Experiment (FLUTE).
