abstract: The linac-based test facility FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac Und Test Experiment)
  at KIT will be used to study novel accelerator technology and provide intense THz
  pulses. In this paper, we present start-to-end simulation studies of FLUTE with
  different bunch charges. We employ a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm for
  different bunch charges of FLUTE to find optimized accelerator settings for the
  generation of intense THz radiation.
