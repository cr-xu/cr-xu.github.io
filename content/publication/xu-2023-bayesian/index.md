abstract: We have evaluated the data-efficient Bayesian optimization method for the
  specific task of injection tuning in a circular accelerator. In this paper, we describe
  the implementation of this method at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator with up
  to nine tuning parameters, including the determination of the associated hyperparameters.
  We show that the Bayesian optimization method outperforms manual tuning and the
  commonly used Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm in both simulation and experiment.
  The algorithm was also successfully used to ease the commissioning phase after the
  installation of new injection magnets and is regularly used during accelerator operations.
  We demonstrate that the introduction of context variables that include intrabunch
  scattering effects, such as the Touschek effect, further improves the control and
  robustness of the injection process.
