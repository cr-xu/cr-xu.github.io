abstract: Online tuning of real-world plants is a complex optimisation problem that
  continues to require manual intervention by experienced human operators. Autonomous
  tuning is a rapidly expanding field of research, where learning-based methods, such
  as Reinforcement Learning-trained Optimisation (RLO) and Bayesian optimisation (BO),
  hold great promise for achieving outstanding plant performance and reducing tuning
  times. Which algorithm to choose in different scenarios, however, remains an open
  question. Here we present a comparative study using a routine task in a real particle
  accelerator as an example, showing that RLO generally outperforms BO, but is not
  always the best choice. Based on the study's results, we provide a clear set of
  criteria to guide the choice of algorithm for a given tuning task. These can ease
  the adoption of learning-based autonomous tuning solutions to the operation of complex
  real-world plants, ultimately improving the availability and pushing the limits
  of operability of these facilities, thereby enabling scientific and engineering
  advancements.
