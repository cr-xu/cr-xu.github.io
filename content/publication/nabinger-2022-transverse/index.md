abstract: To generate the electrons to be accelerated, a photoinjection laser is used
  at the linac-based test facility FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac- Und Test Experiment)
  at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The properties of the laser pulse,
  such as intensity, laser spot size or temporal profile, are the first parameters
  to influence the characteristics of the electron bunches. In order to control the
  initial parameters of the electrons in the most flexible way possible, the laser
  optics at FLUTE are therefore supplemented by additional setups that allow transverse
  and longitudinal laser pulse shaping by using so-called Spatial Light Modulators
  (SLMs). In the future, the control of the SLMs will be integrated into a Machine
  Learning (ML) supported feedback system for the optimization of the electron bunch
  properties. In this contribution the first test experiments and results on laser
  pulse shaping at FLUTE on the way to this project are presented.
