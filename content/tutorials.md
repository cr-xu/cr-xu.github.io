In recent years, we have given lectures and tutorials on machine topics at various occasions. I have gathered the available ones and provided the link below:

- [Neural network basics](#neural-network-basics)
- [Bayesian optimization](#bayesian-optimization)
- [Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning)

## Neural network basics

1. Tutorial on basic concepts of neural networks using PyTorch, with an example of training a small NN to classify the MNIST dataset. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/machine-learning-tutorial/neural-networks)

## Bayesian optimization

1. Tutorial on basic Bayesian optimization techniques with an example for particle accelerator tuning using `BoTorch`. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/machine-learning-tutorial/bayesian-optimization)
2. The same content was given as a guest lecture in the M.Sc. lecture series _Numerical Methods of Accelerator Physics_ at TU Darmstadt. [2022/23 - Lecture 14](https://github.com/aoeftiger/TUDa-NMAP-14) and [2023/24 - Lecture 11](https://github.com/aoeftiger/TUDa-NMAP-2023/tree/main/lecture-11)
3. Tutorial on basic Bayesian optimization using `scikit-learn`, originally given at the 10th MT-ARD-ST3 pre-meeting machine learning workshop [(indico link)](https://indico.desy.de/event/35272/). Link to the tutorial [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ansantam/2022-MT-ARD-ST3-ML-workshop)

## Reinforcement Learning

1. Demonstration of using reinforcement learning to control the linear accelerator ARES, originally given at the RL4AA'23 workshop [(indico link)](https://indico.scc.kit.edu/event/3280/overview). The tutorial is further presented at the 4th ICFA Beam Dynamics ML-Workshop [(indico link)](https://www.indico.kr/event/47/overview) and the 12th MT-ARD-ST3 pre-meeting machine learning workshop [(indico link)](https://indico.desy.de/event/44715/).
   - Link to the tutorial [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RL4AA/RL4AA23)
2. Using Meta-RL and GP-MPC to tune the orbit of the AWAKE accelerator, originally given at the RL4AA'24 workshop [(indico link)](https://indico.scc.kit.edu/event/3746/).
   - Link to the tutorial [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RL4AA/rl4aa24-tutorial)
