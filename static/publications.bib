  abstract = {We have evaluated the data-efficient Bayesian optimization method for the specific task of injection tuning in a circular accelerator. In this paper, we describe the implementation of this method at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator with up to nine tuning parameters, including the determination of the associated hyperparameters. We show that the Bayesian optimization method outperforms manual tuning and the commonly used Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm in both simulation and experiment. The algorithm was also successfully used to ease the commissioning phase after the installation of new injection magnets and is regularly used during accelerator operations. We demonstrate that the introduction of context variables that include intrabunch scattering effects, such as the Touschek effect, further improves the control and robustness of the injection process.},

  Abstract = {Online tuning of particle accelerators is a complex optimisation problem that continues to require manual intervention by experienced human operators. Autonomous tuning is a rapidly expanding field of research, where learning-based methods like Bayesian optimisation (BO) hold great promise in improving plant performance and reducing tuning times. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) is a capable method of learning intelligent controllers, and recent work shows that RL can also be used to train domain-specialised optimisers in so-called reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO). In parallel efforts, both algorithms have found successful adoption in particle accelerator tuning. Here we present a comparative case study, assessing the performance of both algorithms while providing a nuanced analysis of the merits and the practical challenges involved in deploying them to real-world facilities. Our results will help practitioners choose a suitable learning-based tuning algorithm for their tuning tasks, accelerating the adoption of autonomous tuning algorithms, ultimately improving the availability of particle accelerators and pushing their operational limits.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a powerful solution to the modern challenges in accelerator physics. However, the limited availability of beam time, the computational cost of simulations, and the high dimensionality of optimization problems pose significant challenges in generating the required data for training state-of-the-art machine learning models. In this work, we introduce cheetah, a pytorch-based high-speed differentiable linear beam dynamics code. cheetah enables the fast collection of large datasets by reducing computation times by multiple orders of magnitude and facilitates efficient gradient-based optimization for accelerator tuning and system identification. This positions cheetah as a user-friendly, readily extensible tool that integrates seamlessly with widely adopted machine learning tools. We showcase the utility of cheetah through five examples, including reinforcement learning training, gradient-based beamline tuning, gradient-based system identification, physics-informed Bayesian optimization priors, and modular neural network surrogate modeling of space charge effects. The use of such a high-speed differentiable simulation code will simplify the development of machine learning-based methods for particle accelerators and fast-track their integration into everyday operations of accelerator facilities.},

    abstract = {In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of outperforming existing methods on accelerator tuning tasks. However, RL algorithms are difficult and time-consuming to train and currently need to be retrained for every single task. This makes fast deployment in operation difficult and hinders collaborative efforts in this research area. At the same time, modern accelerators often reuse certain structures within or across facilities such as transport lines consisting of several magnets, leading to similar tuning tasks. In this contribution, we use different methods, such as domain randomization, to allow an agent trained in simulation to easily be deployed for a group of similar tasks. Preliminary results show that this training method is transferable and allows the RL agent to control the beam trajectory at similar lattice sections of two different real linear accelerators. We expect that future work in this direction will enable faster deployment of learning-based tuning routines, and lead towards the ultimate goal of autonomous operation of accelerator systems and transfer of RL methods to most accelerators.}

    abstract = {Parameter tuning is a regular task and takes considerable time for daily operations at FEL facilities. In this contribution, we demonstrate SASE pulse energy optimization at the European XFEL with Bayesian optimization (BO) as an alternative approach to the widely used simplex method. Preliminary experimental results show that BO could reach a comparable performance as the simplex method, even with an out-of-the-box implementation. Compared to previous attempts, our version of BO does not require setting hyperparameters via additional measurements, thus effectively reducing the required effort for machine operators to use it during operation. On the other hand, BO has the potential to be further improved by introducing prior physical knowledge about the task and fine-tuning the algorithm to specific tasks. This makes BO a promising candidate for routine tuning tasks at particle accelerators in the future.}

The properties of the laser pulse, such as intensity, laser spot size or temporal profile, are the first parameters to influence the characteristics of the electron bunches. In order to control the initial parameters of the electrons in the most flexible way possible, the laser optics at FLUTE are therefore supplemented by additional setups that allow transverse and longitudinal laser pulse shaping by using so-called Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs). In the future, the control of the SLMs will be integrated into a Machine Learning (ML) supported feedback system for the optimization of the electron bunch properties. In this contribution the first test experiments and results on laser pulse shaping at FLUTE on the way to this project are presented.}},

  abstract     = {{FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac- und Test-Experiment) at KIT is a compact linac-based test facility for novel accelerator technology and a source of intense THz radiation. FLUTE is designed to provide a wide range of electron bunch charges from the pC- to nC-range, high electric fields up to 1.2 GV/m, and ultra-short THz pulses down to the fs-timescale. The electrons are generated at the RF photoinjector, where the electron gun is driven by a commercial titanium sapphire laser. In this kind of setup the electron beam properties are determined by the photoinjector, but more importantly by the characteristics of the laser pulses. Spatial light modulators can be used to transversely and longitudinally shape the laser pulse, offering a flexible way to shape the laser beam and subsequently the electron beam, influencing the produced THz pulses. However, nonlinear effects inherent to the laser manipulation (transportation, compression, third harmonic generation) can distort the original pulse. In this paper we propose to use machine learning methods to manipulate the laser and electron bunch, aiming to generate tailor-made THz pulses. The method is demonstrated experimentally in a test setup.}},

The work is carried out in parallel at two similar research accelerators: ARES at DESY and FLUTE at KIT, giving the unique opportunity of transfer learning between facilities.
