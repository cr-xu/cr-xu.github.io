In this contribution, we demonstrate SASE pulse energy optimization at the European XFEL with Bayesian optimization (BO) as an alternative approach to the widely used simplex method. Preliminary experimental results show that BO could reach a comparable performance as the simplex method, even with an out-of-the-box implementation. Compared to previous attempts, our version of BO does not require setting hyperparameters via additional measurements, thus effectively reducing the required effort for machine operators to use it during operation. On the other hand, BO has the potential to be further improved by introducing prior physical knowledge about the task and fine-tuning the algorithm to specific tasks. This makes BO a promising candidate for routine tuning tasks at particle accelerators in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Optimization for SASE Tuning at the European XFEL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenran Xu","Erik Bründermann","Anke-Susanne Müller","Andrea Santamaria Garcia","Annika Eichler","Jan Kaiser"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1687824e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695807149,"objectID":"a107f2406d3259f869395a5217e08768","permalink":"https://cr-xu.github.io/publication/xu-2023-beam/","publishdate":"2023-09-27T09:32:28.868713Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2023-beam/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of outperforming existing methods on accelerator tuning tasks. However, RL algorithms are difficult and time-consuming to train and currently need to be retrained for every single task. This makes fast deployment in operation difficult and hinders collaborative efforts in this research area. At the same time, modern accelerators often reuse certain structures within or across facilities such as transport lines consisting of several magnets, leading to similar tuning tasks. In this contribution, we use different methods, such as domain randomization, to allow an agent trained in simulation to easily be deployed for a group of similar tasks. Preliminary results show that this training method is transferable and allows the RL agent to control the beam trajectory at similar lattice sections of two different real linear accelerators. We expect that future work in this direction will enable faster deployment of learning-based tuning routines, and lead towards the ultimate goal of autonomous operation of accelerator systems and transfer of RL methods to most accelerators.","tags":[],"title":"Beam trajectory control with lattice-agnostic reinforcement learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Kaiser","Chenran Xu","Annika Eichler","Andrea Santamaria Garcia","Oliver Stein","Erik Bründermann","Willi Kuropka","Hannes Dinter","Frank Mayet","Thomas Vinatier","Florian Burkart","Holger Schlarb"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1686009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694090697,"objectID":"f57d58441ae7d75a07ffa644fb6b1123","permalink":"https://cr-xu.github.io/publication/kaiser-2023-learning/","publishdate":"2023-09-07T15:10:12.757026Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kaiser-2023-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Online tuning of real-world plants is a complex optimisation problem that continues to require manual intervention by experienced human operators. Autonomous tuning is a rapidly expanding field of research, where learning-based methods, such as Reinforcement Learning-trained Optimisation (RLO) and Bayesian optimisation (BO), hold great promise for achieving outstanding plant performance and reducing tuning times. Which algorithm to choose in different scenarios, however, remains an open question. Here we present a comparative study using a routine task in a real particle accelerator as an example, showing that RLO generally outperforms BO, but is not always the best choice. Based on the study's results, we provide a clear set of criteria to guide the choice of algorithm for a given tuning task. These can ease the adoption of learning-based autonomous tuning solutions to the operation of complex real-world plants, ultimately improving the availability and pushing the limits of operability of these facilities, thereby enabling scientific and engineering advancements.","tags":[],"title":"Learning to Do or Learning While Doing: Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Optimisation for Online Continuous Tuning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenran Xu","Tobias Boltz","Akira Mochihashi","Andrea Santamaria Garcia","Marcel Schuh","Anke-Susanne Müller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694090697,"objectID":"57417b3ad68e85ab86a2c10ec9256681","permalink":"https://cr-xu.github.io/publication/xu-2023-bayesian/","publishdate":"2023-09-07T15:10:11.736797Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2023-bayesian/","section":"publication","summary":"We have evaluated the data-efficient Bayesian optimization method for the specific task of injection tuning in a circular accelerator.

In order to control the initial parameters of the electrons in the most flexible way possible, the laser optics at FLUTE are therefore supplemented by additional setups that allow transverse and longitudinal laser pulse shaping by using so-called Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs). In the future, the control of the SLMs will be integrated into a Machine Learning (ML) supported feedback system for the optimization of the electron bunch properties.

FLUTE is designed to provide a wide range of electron bunch charges from the pC- to nC-range, high electric fields up to 1.2 GV/m, and ultra-short THz pulses down to the fs-timescale. The electrons are generated at the RF photoinjector, where the electron gun is driven by a commercial titanium sapphire laser. In this kind of setup the electron beam properties are determined by the photoinjector, but more importantly by the characteristics of the laser pulses. Spatial light modulators can be used to transversely and longitudinally shape the laser pulse, offering a flexible way to shape the laser beam and subsequently the electron beam, influencing the produced THz pulses. However, nonlinear effects inherent to the laser manipulation (transportation, compression, third harmonic generation) can distort the original pulse. In this paper we propose to use machine learning methods to manipulate the laser and electron bunch, aiming to generate tailor-made THz pulses. The method is demonstrated experimentally in a test setup.","tags":["laser","electron","network","target","experiment"],"title":"Machine Learning Based Spatial Light Modulator Control for the Photoinjector Laser at FLUTE","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
